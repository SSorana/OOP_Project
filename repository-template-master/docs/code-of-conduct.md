# Code of conduct

1. Decisions involving major changes are discussed in the group chat and made on the basis of consensus. A major change is considered to be any change that drastically affects the workflow and the outcome of the final product (e.g.: changes in code functionality, changes of priorities, etc.). Every big group decision should be made on the basis of a consensus.
1. We will have meetings on the designated OOPp slots on Monday(11:00e-12:45), Wednesday(11:00-13:00) and Friday(13:45-15:45), except for exam week. Attendance is mandatory, unless you have a valid excuse.
1. Being on time for the meetings is mandatory, failing to do so without a valid excuse more than 2 times would result in (being on time = being present within 10 minutes from the start of the meeting)
1. Everyone will need at least 2 approvals for each merge request (excluding the person who made the MR). Keep in mind that this is a minimum, for some larger or more complex MRs, it is a good idea to wait for more approvals. A good way to enforce this and prevent accidental merges is to set an appropriate number of required approvals when making an MR, and not approve your own merge requests.
1. Always test your code before merging to avoid future problems.
1. Write clear comments for any code that is not immediately obvious.
1. If you start working on a task that is not assigned to you, always let everyone know.
1. Finishing a task assigned to you before the agreed deadline is mandatory. Failing to do so would result in having to complete the missed assignments along with the current sprint’s assignments given to you (aka extra workload) and if one misses a deadline 2 times in a row the matter would be brought up in the upcoming TA meeting.
1. If an individual fails to abide by the rules regarding work distribution and task completion more than once, a group meeting would be held such that the root of the problem is discovered and hopefully resolved in a timely manner.
1. At the start of each sprint, the team members agree on a set of common requirement expectations that should be present in the application by the end of the sprint.
1. Always share work-related problems with the team. Interiorised problems can eat away at everyone’s quality of work in a group environment.
1. Understand and accept differences between you and your teammates. Cultures and personalities other than yours exist.
1. Always try to be kind to your coworkers. You never know what they are going through. A distressed and distracted teammate is a detriment to everyone’s performance, and so it’s a detriment to yours, too.
1. Be direct and sincere with your group from the beginning and communicate about things that are bothering you, so you can avoid problems later on.
1. Always try to help your teammates if they are struggling with certain tasks, not everyone has the same experience or is good at the same things as you.
1. Stay friendly and respectful: this should probably go without saying. Don't say things that might hurt others or make them feel uncomfortable.
1. Be open and communicative: try to communicate clearly, make sure everybody knows what to do. Give each other critical, but constructive feedback. If you don't like the way we're doing something, please let us know. And conversely, make sure to check with others before making decisions that could impact the whole group.
1. If I make a mistake (e.g. don't arrive for a meeting, don't complete the task assigned to me in due time, etc.), I will accept responsibility and apologize to my team members. I will learn from my mistakes and take the actions necessary to become better and not repeat history.
1. I will treat everyone as an equal and respect their opinions and suggestions.
1. Our teamwork is built on the principles of the 3 Cs - Communication, Cooperation and Coordination.
1. Changes to the Code of Conduct would be made at the end of each Sprint. Everyone can suggest changes throughout the sprint, and they are put up for consideration, during which time everyone has the opportunity to express their opinion and vote whether they would like to apply or discard the change. People who are opposed to the suggested change are encouraged to share their opinion or suggest possible rephrasing. Upon reaching consensus the change is added to the Code of Conduct at the end of the Sprint as described earlier. Possible changes may involve Hours of work, Task distribution, Amount of weekly meetings and times for these meetings etc.
